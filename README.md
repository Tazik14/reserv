## Reserv Lite

The GUI version of the utility differs from Lite in the presence of a graphical interface. The Lite version does not.
You can start the Lite-utility using the command line in Windows or terminal in macOS and Linux by running this command:

Linux and macOS:
```sh
python3 startlite.py
```
In Windows, it will be simple enough to double-click on the lite.py file or open it in the Python 3 interpreter, but you can also run it using the command line. This is done like this:
* Step 1
```sh
cd <project folder>
```

* Step 2
```sh
python startlite.py
```
Done!

## Reserv GUI

The utility has a graphical interface, all functions from the Lite version are transferred and supplemented.
> Sorry, but macOS is temporarily not supported.
